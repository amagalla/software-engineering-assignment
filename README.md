Hello,

This is my software engineer assignment from Merkle. This application let's users register their information on a registeration page with confirmation. Also, this applications shows an Admin Report of the registered users sorted by descending order by date of registration.

npm install <br/>
npm run dev to run both the frotend and server <br/>
location will be on localhost:8080
<br />
To connect to Heroku, server.js needs to be in the root folder. Usually, I would put server.js inside of the server folder.
<br />
npm run build to create dist folder for node server to read the frontend
<br />
npm start to start server at localhost:5000
